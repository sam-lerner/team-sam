To run the actual program, enter `npm index`. You will then be taken through a series of prompts to find out the composition of your team. This will start with the manager and then allow the user to enter in as many engineers and interns as they have. At the end of the process, the user will find the generated HTML document in the dist folder.

A sample webpage can be found [here](./dist/index.html).
